# Global Instructions

## Environment

- Dotfiles (incl. shell env) are synced to the SLURM cluster,
  so environment variables are available on every host.

## Julia

- Run the tests that cover your change,
  preferring the targeted subset over the full suite,
  before reporting it done.

### Docstrings

- Follow the official Julia style guide
  ([Writing Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/)).
- Use the short-form signature (no type annotations)
  for closely-related bindings
  (e.g. `evaluate_gaussian`/`evaluate_lorentzian`).
- Give a type the `Type <: Super` docstring signature
  and the outer constructor its own docstring (`Type(args)`)
  when it has meaningful behavior (e.g. defaults).

### File Structure

Within each file,
group the definitions in this order,
with functions sorted alphabetically inside each block:

- define the struct with potential inner creator

- outer creators

- methods using the struct

- `Base` functions using the struct

- other modules (e.g. `LinearAlgebra`) using the struct

### Tests

- Prefer hardcoded expected numerical values
  over comparing the function to itself.

## KISS

Keep it simple, stupid. Don't over-engineer stuff.

## LaTeX

- Use upright forms for mathematical constants.
  Examples: `\mathrm{i}` for imaginary unit,
  `\mathrm{e}` for Euler's constant.

## Markdown

- Break lines at logical locations
  (commas, brackets, sentence ends)
  rather than in the middle of words or arbitrary positions.
  Start a new sentence on a new line.
  Take this file as a reference.
- Keep lines under ~100 characters
  (URLs, LaTeX, code blocks, and tables may exceed this when longer lines read better).
- Sort sections alphabetically in `AGENTS.md` files.
  This file serves as a reference.

## Pi Config Location

The pi config directory is given by the `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` environment variable
(not `~/.pi/agent`).

## Style

- Keep responses concise.
- Insert a space between a number and its unit prefix
  (per BIPM's official guideline:
  "25 M", "3 kg", "5 km", not "25M", "3kg", "5km").
- Label shell code with the most specific language that fits:
  `sh` / `#!/bin/sh` for POSIX shell,
  `bash` / `#!/bin/bash` only when bash-specific features are used.
